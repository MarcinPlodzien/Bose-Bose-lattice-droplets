# Bose-Bose lattice droplets

This code is devoted to studies of the ground state properties of two-component Bose-Hubbard mode in 1D within the Matrix Product State (ansatz using 
ITensor v3 C++ implementation).

The code calculates:
  1. Ground state within desired accuracy of the entropy at the central bond
  2. one- and two-body correlators

Repo contains:
  1. Source code
  2. Jupyter notebook with two-component Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian and calculated quantities
